# Authentication_with_username_password
 Basic authentication system using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. Users can register and log in with email and password.


This repository is part of a step-by-step authentication series implemented using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**. Each level adds a layer of security or authentication technique to help learners understand how real-world login systems evolve from basic to more secure practices.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is for educational purposes only. Do **not** use Level 1 in production environments.
